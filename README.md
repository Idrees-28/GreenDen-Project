## Project Overview

GreenDen is a [brief description of the project, e.g., a dynamic web application designed to help users manage their gardening tasks]. The project utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and flexible styling.

## Installation

To get started with GreenDen:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run the command to install all required dependencies.
3. **Build Tailwind CSS**: Compile Tailwind CSS to generate the final CSS files.
4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to view and interact with the project locally.

## Project Structure

The GreenDen project is organized into the following key directories and files:

- **/public**: Contains the main HTML file.
- **/src/components**: Houses reusable UI components.
- **/src/pages**: Contains page-specific components and layout structures.
- **/src/styles**: Includes the Tailwind CSS entry point and custom styles.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
- **postcss.config.js**: Configuration for PostCSS.

## Configuration

Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js`, where you can customize the framework to fit your design needs. This includes setting up custom themes, colors, and other utility classes.

## Usage

To style your components, use Tailwind's utility classes directly within your HTML or JavaScript files. Tailwind's utility-first approach provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be combined to achieve the desired design.

- **Lint Code**: Check for code style issues.
- **Run Tests**: Execute project tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
- **Format Code**: Automatically format your code using Prettier.
